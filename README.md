# KlusterG.AutoGui

Library developed to facilitate the use of native windows components, such as defining the cursor position, sending keyboard shortcuts, or simulating keyboard typing.

# How To Import?

* Click on Code and download in .zip (can be done in other ways, I'm saying the simplest).
* Extract the content somewhere where you can locate it later (it can be placed together with the project you want to use, even within the solution itself).
* Access the KlusterG.AutoGui project and compile it.
* After compiled, you will have the .dll inside the bin.Debug.net6.0 folder. Once that's done, open the project you want to import the library.
* In your project, you will have the Dependencies component, click with the right mouse button and go to "Add Project Reference...".
* Click on Browse and locate the .dll file that was generated by the library, select it and click on add, after that, click on OK and your project will already have the library loaded.
